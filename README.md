Project Overview
This movie search engine allows users to search for movies by entering keywords. It fetches movie data from a movie API, displays the results, and provides a basic user interface for searching.

Prerequisites
Before getting started, you'll need the following:

An API key from a movie database API (e.g., The Movie Database (TMDb))
A code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code)
A modern web browser
Getting Started
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

bash
Copy code
Open the project directory in your code editor.

API Configuration
Sign up for an API key from The Movie Database (TMDb).

Replace YOUR_API_KEY in script.js with your actual API key.

HTML Structure
Edit the HTML structure in index.html as needed. You can customize the layout and styling according to your preferences. Ensure that you have an input field for user queries and a container for displaying results.

JavaScript Code
In script.js, you'll find the JavaScript code for fetching movie data and displaying results. Customize this code according to your needs. Comments within the code explain its functionality.

Running the Project
To run the project:

Open index.html in a web browser.

Enter a movie search query in the input field and press Enter.

The movie results will be displayed on the page.
